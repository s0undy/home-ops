### Home-ops with K8s and friends üë™
Automated with [Flux](https://fluxcd.io), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)  ü§ñ

# üìÑ Overview
This is a monorepo for a Kubernetes cluster running in my apartment. Applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps as much as possible using the likes of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and many more awesome tools while learning on the fly.

## ‚õµ Kubernetes
I run a 6 node hyper-converged (HCI) [Talos](https://www.talos.dev) cluster comprised of 3 control-plane nodes and 3 worker nodes. The only aspect that makes it semi-hyper-converged is that some workloads use storage from my NAS via NFS mounts.

If you find this interesting and want to get started doing something similar I can strongly recommend taking a look at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template)

### Core Components
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/): Gitops for Kubernetes
- [Cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Requests SSL certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): eBPF-based Internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [Cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Secure access to certain ingresses via Cloudflare.
- [External-DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider.
- [Ingress-NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Kubernetes ingress controller using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [Rook-Ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block, file and S3 storage for persistent storage.
- [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are committed to Git.
- [Spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.


### Directory
The repository should look something like this. (Subject to change)

```
üìÅ .devcontainer        # Container containing(hehe) all tools needed to run the cluster
üìÅ .github           # Github workflows and Renovate config
üìÅ .taskfiles       # Useful taskfiles for easy administration & setup of the cluster
üìÅ .vscode          # VSCode config
üìÅ docs             # Documentation about the repository
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps           # Contains all applications and resources that flux will apply
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ bootstrap      # bootstrap procedures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux           # core flux configuration
üìÅ scripts            # Useful scripts
üìÅ terraform          # Terraform code to create resources e.g S3 buckets
```
### Short workflow
[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) watches over cluster in my [kubernetes](https://github.com/s0undy/home-ops/tree/main/kubernetes) folder and makes changes based on the state of the repository.

Flux recursively searches the `kubernetes/` directory for the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and applies all the resources listed in it. The `kustomization.yaml` generally only consists of a namespace and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). The `ks.yaml` will reference a HelmRelease or other resources that will be applied and deployed to the cluster.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches over the repo looking for dependency updates, such as new versions of containers and when they are found a pull-request is automagically created in this repository. When I merge these pull-requests, Flux will detect changes to the repository and apply them to the cluster. Magic! ‚ú®

## üåê DNS

### Cluster/Public
In the cluster, I run [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), which creates DNS records in Cloudflare to publish ingresses that has the class name of `external` and the annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.

### Home DNS
Devices on the LAN use Pi-hole, hosted on my UDM-Pro in an nspawn-container, as their DNS. Pi-hole uses the in-cluster external-dns as a conditional forwarder for my domain, allowing me to access resources published from the cluster.

In the future I plan to transition to using UniFi as DNS server on my UDM-Pro and use [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook) to automagically create DNS records.


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Dependencies
Most of my infrastructure is self-hosted, however certain parts are easier and safer to run in the cloud.
